# RPG-Suite and ZZZ Integration Specification

## Objective
Integrate the RPG-Suite WordPress plugin with the ZZZ containerized WordPress environment to create an interactive RPG gaming platform with BuddyPress social features.

## Current State
- RPG-Suite has all core components and 5 subsystems fully implemented
- ZZZ has a functioning WordPress container system with BuddyPress
- The integration between the two systems has not yet been completed

## Implementation Requirements

### Phase 1: Plugin Integration
1. **Script-Based Deployment**
   - Create deployment scripts to copy RPG-Suite into WordPress plugins directory
   - Add initialization hooks to ZZZ container startup
   - Ensure proper file permissions and ownership
   - Validate plugin appears in WordPress admin

2. **BuddyPress Integration Testing**
   - Verify character actions appear in activity feeds
   - Test xprofile field integration
   - Ensure character limits and switching work correctly
   - Validate privacy settings with BuddyPress friend system

### Phase 2: Admin Interface Development
1. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Create central RPG-Suite admin dashboard
   - Add subsystem toggles
   - Implement global settings panel

2. **Subsystem UIs**
   - Zone management UI for Geo subsystem
   - Dice roller UI for Dice subsystem 
   - Item management UI for Inventory subsystem
   - Character management interface

### Phase 3: Complete Subsystem Implementation
1. **Combat Subsystem**
   - Implement turn-based combat system
   - Add initiative tracking
   - Create combat log system
   - Integrate with Core event system

2. **Quest Subsystem**
   - Implement narrative quest system
   - Add quest tracking and rewards
   - Add REST API endpoints and shortcodes
   - Integrate with Core event system

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation
1. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for each subsystem
   - Integration tests with WordPress and BuddyPress
   - Player journey tests
   - Performance testing

2. **Documentation**
   - User guide
   - Admin guide
   - Developer documentation
   - API documentation

## Technical Approach
- Maintain repositories separately for cleaner development
- Use script-based deployment rather than volume mounting
- Preserve flexibility for later production deployment
- Add staged development of subsystems for backward compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria
- Plugin activates without errors in ZZZ environment
- All subsystems function correctly with BuddyPress integration
- Admin interfaces are intuitive and functional
- Combat and Quest subsystems are fully implemented
- Documentation is complete and accessible
