## May 11, 2025 Test Results

### Key Findings:
1. **CRITICAL: PHP Syntax Error in Character Manager**
   - Unterminated comment starting at line 617 in Character Manager class
   - Error: `PHP Parse error: Unterminated comment starting line 617 in /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/rpg-suite/includes/Character/class-character-manager.php on line 617`
   - The issue is in the `map_character_capabilities` method where a comment block is started with `/*` but not properly closed with `*/`
   - This error causes WordPress to completely break, preventing any operations
   - Cannot continue testing until this is fixed

2. The plugin structure, autoloader, and core components had been functioning correctly before the syntax error
3. Character post type registers successfully and metadata is working
4. The die_code_utility reference in the Character Manager was fixed but couldn't be fully tested due to the syntax error
5. BuddyPress integration is loaded but needs browser-based testing

### Environment Issues:
1. WordPress SEO plugin loading translations too early
2. Multiple "Cannot modify header information" warnings caused by early output
   - Affects wp-login.php, functions.php, and pluggable.php
   - All related to output started at functions.php:6121
   - Could impact redirects, cookies, and authentication
3. Debug mode enabled in production environment

### Methodology Notes:
- Plugin activates without fatal errors
- Global variable $rpg_suite is initialized with all components
- CLI testing confirms that core plugin structure and most functionality is sound
- Browser-based testing is needed for UI components and BuddyPress integration

## Next Implementation Steps

1. Fix the die_code_utility reference in the Character Manager
2. Test BuddyPress integration in a browser environment
3. Add styling for character display in BuddyPress profiles
4. Test character switching in the UI

## Next Testing Focus

1. Test BuddyPress profile display in browser environment with logged-in user
2. Test character switching UI in browser environment
3. Test admin UI for character creation and editing
4. Verify all components work together in real usage scenarios
