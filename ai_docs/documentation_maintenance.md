# Documentation Maintenance Guidelines

## Purpose

The documentation in this repository serves to:

1. Track testing results and code quality assessment
2. Document issues found during testing
3. Provide clear, actionable feedback for developers
4. Maintain a historical record of implementation challenges

## Testing Documentation Workflow

1. **Test execution**: Run tests on the codebase
2. **Issue documentation**: Document any issues found in appropriate .md files
3. **Solution validation**: Test and document effectiveness of implemented solutions
4. **Status updates**: Maintain current status of different components

## Documentation Structure

### AI Docs Directory

This directory contains all testing results, implementation notes, and issue tracking.

- **RPG-Suite/**: Test results and issue tracking for the WordPress plugin
  - **subsystem_status.md**: Overview of testing status for each subsystem
  - **docker_testing.md**: Guide for testing in Docker environment
  - **character_edit_fix_v022.md**: Testing guide for character editing
  - **duplicate_buttons_fix_v022.md**: Testing guide for BuddyPress UI elements
  - **implementation_plan.md**: Testing approach and validation plan

- **documentation_maintenance.md**: Guidelines for maintaining documentation
- **overview.md**: Overall project and testing overview

### Feedback Reports

**IMPORTANT**: All test feedback reports should be written to:
`./RPG-Suite/ai_docs/feedback.md`

This is the primary document used by developers to track issues discovered during testing. Follow the issue documentation format specified below when adding entries to the feedback.md file.

### Specs Directory

This directory contains specifications and requirements that test results should be verified against.

- **RPG-Suite/**: Plugin specifications
  - **test_plan.md**: Comprehensive test plan with methodology and objectives

## Documentation Standards

1. **Clear issue description**: Describe issues with specific examples
2. **Reproducible steps**: Document exact steps to reproduce issues
3. **Solution validation**: Document how solutions were tested
4. **Status indicators**: Clearly mark issues as [PASS], [FAIL], or [PARTIAL]

## Test Documentation Best Practices

1. **Precision**: Be precise about what was tested and observed
2. **Objectivity**: Document what actually happened, not expectations
3. **Completeness**: Include all relevant information about test environment
4. **Consistency**: Use consistent formatting for all test reports
5. **Actionability**: Make documentation useful for addressing issues

## Test Report Structure

Every test report should include:

1. **Test environment**: WordPress version, BuddyPress version, theme, browser
2. **User personas**: User roles and permissions tested
3. **Test scenarios**: Specific use cases and workflows tested
4. **Observed behavior**: Exact system behavior during testing
5. **Issues found**: Clear description of any issues with reproduction steps
6. **Recommendations**: Suggested next steps or follow-up testing
